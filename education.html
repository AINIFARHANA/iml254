                    Before transferring to National School Bukit Payong (SKBP) in Terengganu to finish my studies up to secondary school, I attended TLDM Basic National School (SKPTLDM 1) in Perak till I was in grade 4. In fifth grade, I received an award for being the
                    <span class="read-more-text"> class's finest fifth grader. Furthermore, I received honors as the "SPM 2021 best student" and as the top student in the current fifth form during my time at Seri Payong National High School (SMKSP).In Perak, I have a lot of multiracial friends. Additionally, Iban people are quite friendly and I am friends with them. I used to have a higher proportion of male than female friends. The Indian instructor with whom I am also connected is really kind to me.

            <h2 class="section__title">Higher Education!</h2>
            <p>Following my graduation from high school, I enrolled in a diploma program in library informatics. I began my university education at Univeristi Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Kedah in 2022. 
                It has been an enriching journey filled with new knowledge, challenges, and growth. I chose a diploma in informatic library because it combines my passion for technology with my interest in organizing and managing information efficiently. From exploring diverse subjects to engaging in extracurricular 
                activities, my time here has truly shaped my academic and personal development. I'm in my fourth semester now, and I can keep my pointer sharp. I'm attempting to learn things
                here that I haven't tried before, for instance, using Adobe, cataloging books, and coding. Focused learning has been the cornerstone of my university education, as I devote my attention to every lecture, 
                seminar, and workshop to acquire a comprehensive understanding of my chosen field. I am excited to take the next step in my academic journey and pursue a degree in informatic library science, expanding my knowledge and expertise to new heights.
